Postural yoga has been studied and recommended to promote relaxation, reduce stress and improve some medical conditions such as
premenstrual syndrome. This form of yoga provides the same benefit as "any well-designed excercise program, increasing general health
and stamina, reducing stress and improving those conditions brought about by sedentary lifestyle".It is particularly promoted as a
physical therapy routine, and as a regime to strengthen and balance all parts of the body.
